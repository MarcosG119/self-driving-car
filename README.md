# World of AI Self-Driving Cars

Using the world builder you can create your own world with the world builder repository. This world will then populate with self driving cars. The cars will avoid boundaries and each other. You can control your car as it is surrounded by other cars. This project was started using a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp however I am now turning it into something of my own. 

## Technology Used

It is built entirely with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Even the neural network is build entirely with Javascript. 

## How to Run It

Simplay open index.html in a browser.

## Next Steps

1. Make vehicles obey traffic signals.
2. Add a line of debris behind vehicles.
3. Trigger collision detection if a car runs into the debris.
4. Make it into a Snake.io type of game but on the road powered by neural networks.
